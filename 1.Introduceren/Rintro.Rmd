Welcome
========

Materials and setup 
-------------------

**NOTE: skip this section if you are not running R locally** (e.g., if you are
running R in your browser using a remote Jupyter server)

You should have R installed --if not:

-   Download and install R from http://cran.r-project.org
-   Download and install RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

Notes and examples for this workshop are available at 
[](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/Rintro.html)

Start RStudio and open a new R script:
-   On Windows click the start button and search for rstudio. On Mac
    RStudio will be in your applications folder.
-   In Rstudio go to `File -> New File -> R Script`

What is R?
----------

R is a *programming language designed for statistical computing*.
Notable characteristics include:

-   Vast capabilities, wide range of statistical and graphical
    techniques
-   Very popular in academia, growing popularity in business:
    <http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/>
-   Written primarily by statisticians
-   FREE (no monetary cost and open source)
-   Excellent community support: mailing list, blogs, tutorials
-   Easy to extend by writing new functions

Whatever you're trying to do, you're probably not the first to try doing
it R. Chances are good that someone has already written a package for
that.

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
================================

There are many different ways you can interact with R. See
[](http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/DataScienceTools/DataScienceTools.html)
for details. 

For this workshop I encourage you to use RStudio; it is a good
R-specific IDE that mostly just works.

Launch RStudio (skip if not using Rstudio)
------------------------------------------
**Note: skip this section if you are not using Rstudio (e.g., if you are running
these examples in a Jupyter notebook).**

-   Start the RStudio program
-   In RStudio, go to **File =&gt; New File =&gt R Script**

The window in the upper-left is your R script. This is where you will
write instructions for R to carry out.

The window in the lower-left is the R console. This is where results
will be displayed.

Exercise 0
----------

The purpose of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to explore
the interface provided by RStudio (or whichever GUI you've decided to
use). You may not know how to do these things; that's fine! This is an
opportunity to figure it out.

Also keep in mind that we are living in a golden age of tab completion.
If you don't know the name of an R function, try guessing the first two
or three letters and pressing TAB. If you guessed correctly the function
you are looking for should appear in a pop up!

-------------------------------------------

1.  Try to get R to add 2 plus 2.
```{r}
##
```
2.  Try to calculate the square root of 10.
```{r}
##
```
3.  R includes extensive documentation, including a file named "An
    introduction to R". Try to find this help file.


Exercise 0 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------


```{r, purl = FALSE}
## 1. 2 plus 2
2 + 2
## or
sum(2, 2)

## 2. square root of 10:
sqrt(10)
## or
10^(1/2)


## 3. Find "An Introduction to R".

## Go to the main help page by running 'help.start() or using the GUI
## menu, find and click on the link to "An Introduction to R".

```


R basics
========


Function calls
---------

The general form for calling R functions is

```{r eval=FALSE}
## FunctionName(arg.1 = value.1, arg.2 = value.2, ..., arg.n - value.n)
```

Arguments can be matched by name; unnamed arguments will be matched by position.

Assignment
----------

Values can be assigned names and used in subsequent operations

-   The `<-` operator (less than followed by a dash) is used to save
    values
-   The name on the left gets the value on the right.

```{r}
sqrt(10) ## calculate square root of 10; result is not stored anywhere
x <- sqrt(10) # assign result to a variable named x
```

Asking R for help
---------------------

You can ask R for help using the `help` function, or the `?` shortcut.

```{r}
help(help)
```

The `help` function can be used to look up the documentation for a function, or
to look up the documentation to a package. We can learn how to use the `stats`
package by reading its documentation like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(package = "stats")
```

Example project: baby names!
===============

General goals
--------------

I would like to know what the most popular baby names are. In the course of
answering this question we will learn to call R functions, install and load
packages, assign values to names, read and write data, and more.

Data sets
----------

The examples in this workshop use the baby names data provided by the
governments of the United States and the United Kingdom. A cleaned and
merged version of these data is available at
`http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv`.


Getting data into R
===================

R has data reading functionality built-in -- see e.g.,
`help(read.table)`. However, faster and more robust tools are
available, and so to make things easier on ourselves we will use a
*contributed package* called `readr` instead. This requires that we
learn a little bit about packages in R.

Installing and using R packages
----------------------------------------------------

A large number of contributed packages are available. If you are
looking for a package for a specific task,
https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ and https://r-pkg.org are good
places to start.

You can install a package in R using the `install.packages()`
function. Once a package is installed you may use the `library`
function to attach it so that it can be used.

```{r}
## install.packages("readr")
library(readr)
```

Readers for common file types
-----------------------------

In order to read data from a file, you have to know what kind of file
it is. The table below lists functions that can import data from
common plain-text formats.

| Data Type                 | Function        |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| comma separated           | `read_csv()`    |
| tab separated             | `read_delim()`  |
| other delimited formats   | `read_table()`  |
| fixed width               | `read_fwf()`    |

**Note** You may be confused by the existence of similar functions,
e.g., `read.csv` and `read.delim`. These are legacy functions that
tend to be slower and less robust than the `readr` functions. One way
to tell them apart is that the faster more robust versions use
underscores in their names (e.g., `read_csv`) while the older
functions us dots (e.g., `read.csv`). My advice is to use the more
robust newer versions, i.e., the ones with underscores.

Exercise 2
----------

The purpose of this exercise is to practice reading data into R.

1.  Open the help page for the `read_csv` function. How can you limit
    the number of rows to be read in?
```{r}
##
```
2.  Read just the first 10 rows of
"`"http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv`".
```{r}
##
```
3.  Once you have successfully read in the first 10 rows, read the whole
    file, assigning the result to the name `baby.names`.
```{r}
##
```

Exercise 2 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
## read ?read_csv

## limit rows with nrows argument
library(readr)
babyNames <- read_csv("C:/Users/HarrieJonkman/OneDrive - Verwey-Jonker Instituut/Rcursus/1.Introduceren/babyNames.csv",
                      n_max = 10 )
#read_csv("http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv",
#        n_max = 10)
## read all the data
baby.names <- read_csv("C:/Users/HarrieJonkman/OneDrive - Verwey-Jonker Instituut/Rcursus/1.Introduceren/babyNames.csv")
```

Data Manipulation
=================

data.frame objects
------------------

Usually data read into R will be stored as a **data.frame**

-   A data.frame is a list of vectors of equal length
    -   Each vector in the list forms a column
    -   Each column can be a differnt type of vector
    -   Typically columns are variables and the rows are observations

A data.frame has two dimensions corresponding the number of rows and the
number of columns (in that order)

Tools for manipulating data.frame objects
----------------------------------------------------

R has decent data manipulation tools built-in -- see e.g.,
`help(Extract)`. However, these tools are powerful and complex and
often overwhelm beginners. To make things easier on ourselves we will
use a *contributed package* called `dplyr` instead.

```{r}
## install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

Checking imported data
----------------------

It is always a good idea to examine the imported data set--usually we
want the results to be a `data.frame`

```{r}
class(baby.names) # check to see that it os a data.frame
```

We can get more information about R objects using the `glimpse` function.

```{r}
glimpse(baby.names) # structure
```

```{r}
View(baby.names) # visually inspect
```

Filter data.frame rows
---------------------------------

You can extract subsets of data.frames using `filter` to select rows
meeting some condition.

```{r}
## rows where Name == "jill"
filter(baby.names, Name == "jill")
```

```{r}
## rows where Year is 1996 and Name is either "jack" or "jill"
filter(baby.names, Year == 1996 & Name %in% c("jack", "jill"))
```

In the previous example we used `==` to filter rows. Other relational
and logical operators are listed below.

 | Operator  | Meaning                   | 
 | ----------| --------------------------| 
 | `==`      | equal to                  | 
 | `!=`      | not equal to              | 
 | `>`       | greater than              | 
 | `>=`      | greater than or equal to  | 
 | `<`       | less than                 | 
 | `<=`      | less than or equal to     | 
 | `%in%`    | contained in              | 

These operators may be combined with `&` (and) or `|` (or).


Exercise 2: Data Extraction
-----------------------------

Read in the "babyNames.csv" file if you have not already done so,
assigning the result to `baby.names`. The file is located at "http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv"

1.  Extract data for the name "ashley".  
```{r}
##
```

2.  Restrict the previous extraction to include only years between 2000 and 2004.
```{r}
##
```


Exercise 2 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, purl = FALSE}
## 1. Extract data for the name "ashley".
filter(baby.names, Name == "ashley")

## 2.  Restrict the previous extraction to include only years between 2000 and 2004.
filter(baby.names,
       Year >= 2000 &
       Year <= 2004 &
       Name == "ashley")
```

Adding, removing, and modifying data.frame columns
--------------------------------------------------

You can modify data.frames using `mutate` function. It works like this:

```{r}
baby.names <- mutate(baby.names, Thousands = Count/1000)
baby.names
```

Often one needs to replace values conditionally, as in the following example:

```{r}
baby.names <- mutate(
    baby.names,
    Decade = case_when(Year < 2000                ~ "1990's",
                       Year >= 2000 & Year < 2010 ~ "2000's",
                       Year < 2020                ~ "2010's",
                       TRUE                       ~ as.character(Year)))

head(baby.names)
tail(baby.names)
```


Exercise 3: Data manipulation
-----------------------------

Read in the "babyNames.csv" file if you have not already done so,
assigning the result to `baby.names`. The file is located at "http://tutorials.iq.harvard.edu/R/Rintro/dataSets/babyNames.csv"


1.  Ifyou look at `unique(baby.names$Sex)` you'll notice that some
    records indicate Male with `"M"`, while other records use
    `"Male"`. Correct this by replacing `"M"` with `"Male"`.
```{r}
##
```

2.  Create a column named "Popular" containing a 1 in rows where Count
    is greater than 30000 and a 0 otherwise
```{r}
##
```

3.  Filter the baby names data to display only the popular names.
```{r}
##
```

Exercise 3 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, purl = FALSE}
# 1
baby.names <- mutate(baby.names,
                     Sex = case_when(Sex == "M" ~ "Male",
                                     TRUE ~ Sex))

# 2
baby.names <- mutate(baby.names,
                     Popular = case_when(Count < 30000 ~ FALSE,
                                         Count >= 30000 ~ TRUE))

# 3
filter(baby.names, Popular)
```

Grouping and Aggregation
--------------------------

So far we've seen than "Jacob", "Matthew", and "Michael" tend to be
popular names. That isn't very satisfying, because it leaves us
wanting to know which girls names are popular, and perhaps how
popularity has changed over time. To answer these questions we need to
operate on groups within the data rather than on the whole data
structure at once. The `dplyr` package makes this easy to do using the
`group_by` function.

```{r}
baby.names <- mutate(group_by(baby.names, Year, Sex),
                     max_count = max(Count))
head(baby.names)
tail(baby.names)

filter(baby.names,
       Count == max_count)
```

Note that the data remains grouped until you change the groups by
running `group_by` again or remove grouping information with
`ungroup`.

Grouping can be useful when modifying a data.frame with `mutate` or
extracting subsets with `filter`, but it really shines when combined
with `summarize`. For example, suppose that we want the most popular
girl and boy names for each decade. In this case we need to summarize
the by summing the `Count` column for each `Sex X Decade` group.

```{r}
bn.by.decade <- summarize(group_by(baby.names, Decade, Sex, Name),
                          Count = sum(Count),
                          Thousands = sum(Thousands))

filter(group_by(bn.by.decade, Decade, Sex),
                     Count == max(Count))
```

In the previous example we used `sum` and `max`, two examples of basic statistics functions in R. Other basic statistics functions include:
-   `mean`
-   `median`
-   `sd`
-   `var`
-   `min`
-   `quantile`
-   `length`

Exporting Data
--------------

Now that we have made some changes to our data set, we might want to
save those changes to a file.

```{r}
# write data to a .csv file
write_csv(baby.names, "babyNames.csv")

# write data to an R file
write_rds(baby.names, "babyNames.rds")
```

Saving and loading R workspaces
-------------------------------

In addition to importing individual datasets, R can save and load entire
workspaces

```{r}
ls() # list objects in our workspace
save.image(file="myWorkspace.RData") # save workspace 
rm(list=ls()) # remove all objects from our workspace 
ls() # list stored objects to make sure they are deleted

## Load the "myWorkspace.RData" file and check that it is restored
load("myWorkspace.RData") # load myWorkspace.RData
ls() # list objects
```

Exercise 4
----------

1.  Calculate the total number of children born.
```{r}
```
2.  Filter the data to extract data from 2004 and calculate the total
    number of children born in that year.
```{r}
##
```
3.  Calculate the number of boys and girls born each year. Assign the result
    to the name `births.by.year`.
```{r}
##
```

Exercise 4 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>
----------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, purl = FALSE}
## 1.  Calculate the total number of children born.
baby.names <- ungroup(baby.names)
summarize(baby.names, Total = sum(Count))

## 2.  Filter the data to extract data from 2004 and calculate the total
##     number of children born in that year.
summarize(filter(baby.names, Year == 2004), Total = sum(Count))

## 3.  Calculate the number of boys and girls born each year. Assign the result
##     to the name `births.by.year`.
births.by.year <- summarize(group_by(baby.names, Year, Sex),
                            Count = sum(Count))
births.by.year
```

Basic graphs
============

R has decent plotting tools built-in -- see e.g., `help(plot)`.
However, To make things easier on ourselves we will use a *contributed
package* called `ggplot2` instead.


```{r}
## install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

First, we'll plot the number of boys and girls born each year.
```{r}
qplot(Year, Count, color = Sex,
     geom = "line",
     data = births.by.year)
```

Next, we'll filter out the most popular girls names and plot their
popularity over time.

```{r}
popular.girls <- filter(group_by(baby.names, Year, Sex),
                       Sex == "Female" & Count == max(Count))

qplot(Year, Count, color = Name,
     geom = "line",
     data = filter(baby.names,
                   Sex == "Female" & Name %in% popular.girls$Name))
```

Exercise 5
----------

1.  Add a new coloumn to the baby.names data equal to the proportion
    of boys and girls born each year with each name. That is,
    calculate Proportion = Count/sum(Count) for each Year X Sex group.

```{r}
##
```

2.  Filter the baby.names data, retaining only the most popular girl
    and boy names for each year.

```{r}
##
```

3.  Plot proportion over time to see changes in the proportion of
    parents choosing the most popular name of the year.

```{r}
##
```

Exercise 5 solution<span class="tag" data-tag-name="prototype"></span>

```{r, purl = FALSE}
## 1. Add a new coloumn to the baby.names data equal to the proportion

baby.names <- mutate(group_by(baby.names, Year, Sex),
                     Proportion = Count / sum(Count))

## 2. Filter the baby.names data, retaining only the most popular girl
## and boy names for each year.

bn.top.prop <- filter(group_by(baby.names, Year, Sex),
                      Proportion == max(Proportion))

## 3. Plot proportion over time to see changes in the proportion of
## parents choosing the most popular name of the year.
qplot(Year, Proportion, color = Sex,
      geom = "line",
      data = bn.top.prop)
